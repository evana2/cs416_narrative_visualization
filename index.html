            Since 1938 when the Minimum wage was first introduced it has been a highly controversal topic within United States politics. Propenents of minimum wage would prefer it be raised, citing that raising it would lift millions of people out of poverty.
            While others argue that the minimum wage could be removed without affecting many workers salaries and should be removed due to its interference with the ecconomy.
            
            Today we'll look at some of the statistics of minimum wage and how it works, both at a federal and state level.
